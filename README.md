# MSOS Milsuite

With Milsuite being sunset on 31 March 2025, I wanted to put some of the screenshots on here so atleast there is some kind of record of it.  Milsuite was designed as an easy to build solutions platform for organizations within the DOD.  After seeing the uphill battle trying to get the original NextJS MSOS Toolkit would have been, Milsuite was suggested for us to use since it was approved for CUI as it required users to have CAC access in order to log into the site.  We advertised and used it as a resource for our customers as it had direct links to important references they needed (JTR) and there was a blog post I put on there to show them how to find ATTLA letters for their equipment starting with the data plates.  We had some good success with the site, but like with any project started within an organization, once everyone involved in its original creation is gone, you have to rely on future generations to keep it active which it looks like there wasn't as big of a push after me and Timpson left.
